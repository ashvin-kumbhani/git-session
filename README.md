## Introduction to Version Control:
  * Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
  * Centralized Version Control - SVN, TFS
  * Distributed Version Control -GIT

## Git Overview:
  *  Git is distributed, meaning each user has a full copy of the repository. This allows for offline work and faster access.

## Installation and Setup:
  * https://git-scm.com/
  * Configuration: Set user information using `git config --global user.name "Your Name"` and `git config --global user.email your.email@example.com`.

## Basic Git Concepts:
  * Working Directory: The current state of the files on your computer.
  * Staging Area: A space to prepare changes before committing them.
  * Repository: The database where Git stores all the changes.

## Creating a Repository:
  * Initialization: Use `git init` to initialize a new repository.
  * Cloning: Use `git clone <repository URL>` to create a local copy of a remote repository.

## Git Workflow:
  * Add/Stage Changes: `git add <filename>` to stage changes.
  * Commit Changes: `git commit -m "Commit message"` to save changes to the local repository.
  * Pull Changes: `git pull` to fetch changes from a remote repository.
  * Push Changes: `git push` to upload changes to a remote repository 

## Working with Branches:
  * Creating a Branch: Use git branch <branchname> to create a new branch.
  * Switching Branches: Use git checkout <branchname> or git switch <branchname> to switch between branches.
  * Merging Branches: Use git merge <branchname> to merge changes from one branch into another.

## Conflict:
  * Understanding Conflicts: Occurs when Git can't automatically merge changes.
  * Resolving Conflicts: Manually edit conflicted files, mark as resolved with git add, and then commit.

## Collaboration:
  * Pull Requests: A way to propose changes to a repository.
  * Code Reviews: Collaborators review and discuss proposed changes before merging.

## Gitignore:
  * Purpose: Ignore files and directories that shouldn't be tracked by Git.
  * Syntax: Use wildcard patterns in a .gitignore file.

## Git Best Practices:
  * Commit Messages: Be descriptive and concise.
  * Branching Strategies: Follow a branching model like Gitflow.
  * Collaboration: Regularly pull changes, communicate, and use branches effectively.
