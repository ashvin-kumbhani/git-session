# Client-Server Architecture

## 1. Introduction
- **Definition:** Client-server architecture is a model used in computing where tasks or processes are divided between the client (the requester of services) and the server (the provider of services).

## 2. Entities in Client-Server Architecture
### Client
- **What is it?** The client is a device or application that initiates requests for services or resources.
- **Examples:** Your computer, smartphone, or any software application that interacts with a server.

### Server
- **What is it?** The server is a powerful computer or software application that provides services or resources in response to client requests.
- **Examples:** Web servers, database servers, file servers.

## 3. Communication Between Client and Server
- **How it works:**
  - Clients send requests to servers, and servers respond to those requests with the necessary data or services.
  - Communication typically occurs over a network, like the internet or a local network.

## 4. Key Characteristics
- **Stateless Communication:**
  - Each request from a client to a server is independent, meaning the server doesn't retain information about the client between requests.
- **Scalability:**
  - Servers can handle multiple client requests simultaneously, allowing for scalability to accommodate a growing number of users.

## 5. Client Responsibilities
- **Initiates Requests:**
  - Clients request specific services, data, or resources from the server.
  - Examples include fetching a webpage, downloading a file, or submitting a form on a website.

## 6. Server Responsibilities
- **Processes Requests:**
  - Servers receive client requests, process them, and return the requested information or perform the requested task.
  - Examples include serving a webpage, querying a database, or handling user authentication.

## 7. Examples of Client-Server Interactions
- **Web Browsing:**
  - Your web browser (client) sends a request to a web server for a webpage, and the server responds by sending back the HTML, CSS, and other assets needed to display the page.

## 8. Advantages
- **Centralized Management:**
  - Servers provide a centralized point for managing data, applications, and resources.
- **Efficiency:**
  - Clients can be lightweight, focusing on the user interface and interaction, while servers handle the heavy lifting of processing and storing data.

## 9. Challenges
- **Dependency on Network:**
  - Client-server systems rely on network connectivity; if the network fails, communication between clients and servers can be disrupted.
